// What a mise file must be like to pass TestMise, the checker of a mise file against the Go it runs:
//
//  1. Each task's run and usage is written on one line, "…" or '…'. Longer logic belongs in Go, not in the mise file.
//  2. A task runs Go in one of two forms: go run|test|build ./path (Go from its source), or <binary> <command> (a
//     built binary, its Go in <GO_CMD>/<binary>/). Anything else it runs is reported, as not checked.
//  3. A task declares its flags and arguments with mise's usage, and its run passes each by name with mise's own
//     templates, which mise fills in before any shell runs: {% if usage.yes %} --yes{% endif %}. Nothing passes
//     through undeclared, nothing is read the deprecated way, {{flag(…)}}, and no run line has POSIX shell syntax
//     (${…}, $name, NAME=value in front of a command): Windows' cmd doesn't read it, so the task would break there.
//  4. A binary's commands are laid out one way, which the caller says: a file each, <command>.go holding the function
//     named for it, or a folder each.
//  5. Go that runs tasks names each in full, "namespace:task", never glued together from pieces.
//
// It checks both ways: what the mise file names must be in the Go, and what the Go has must be in the mise file.

// TestMise checks a mise file against Go, and only Go, both ways, by the base rule. It knows nothing of this repo: the
// root's task that runs it says what to check, as mise run template:check-mise does:
//
//	MISE_FILE   the mise file (without it, TestMise skips)
//	GO_CMD      the folder of the Go binaries its tasks run, <GO_CMD>/<binary>/   } both, for tasks that run a
//	GO_LAYOUT   how a binary's commands are laid out: file or folder               } built binary, or neither
//	GO_CALLERS  the folder of Go that runs its tasks by name (optional)
//
// The mise side reads any mise file; the other side reads only Go: .go files, <GO_CMD>/<binary>/, Go's flag package. A
// task runs Go in one of two forms (runsOf); anything else it runs is reported as not checked, never passed over. What
// it can't read, a run or a usage that isn't one line, fails: a proper mise file is written so it can be read. It
// never passes on nothing, and it logs what it checked.
