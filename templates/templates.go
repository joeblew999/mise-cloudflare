// Package templates is the template: a whole repo with mise-cloudflare, which runs wherever it is put. It has
// two halves. The tool's half, listed below, is what mise-cloudflare init writes into any repo, at the same paths: the
// .mise folder (the tasks, and mise-cloudflare's pin, which mise install gets from its GitHub releases), the GitHub
// workflow, the Claude Code hook and its settings, the agent skill, the docs and the .gitignore. The rest is the
// template's own Worker (src/, wrangler.jsonc, package.json and its lockfile, mise.toml with what installs its
// wrangler, .dev.vars.example), there so the template runs: init never writes it, and mise-cloudflare template writes
// it into a repo that has no Worker yet. What is for this repo itself (its own mise.toml, tests, CI and README) is
// never here, and neither is the machine's own .mise/config.local.toml.
